## OpenAI Library for ESP32 Arduino

This library currently supports most of the OpenAI API. Exception are `files`, `fine-tunes`.

Examples for almost all endpoints can be found in the `examples` folder.

Library is still in early stages and could sustain some small changes. Some are outlined [here](https://github.com/me-no-dev/OpenAI-ESP32/blob/master/src/OpenAI.cpp#L2-L7)
